# In comments:
# What does randint do? Randint randomly picks a random number.
# What do the values 0 and 3 do? ) This tells the program that the program can only choose a number between 0 and 3. This is the limit.
# Try changing those numbers, rerun the program, and write down what changed.
# When I changed the numbers (0, 3) to (5, 50) It does the same thing. It randomly choose a number between the numbers 5 and 50
# What is the difference between random.randint(0,3) and print(0random.randint(0,3))?
# The first one gives you a ranom number between the numbers 0 and 3 and the second one gives you an error.
